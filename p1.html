    <h1>Etymology:</h1>
    <p>
      The Sanskrit word "Manasarovar" (मानसरोवर) is a combination of two
      Sanskrit words; "Mānas" (मानस्) meaning "mind (in its widest sense as
      applied to all the mental powers), intellect, intelligence, understanding,
      perception, sense, conscience" while "sarovara" (सरोवर) means "a lake or a
      large pond deep enough for a lotus"
    </p>
    <h1>Geography:</h1>
    <p>
      It is located about 50 kilometers to the northwest of Nepal, about 100
      kilometers east of Uttarakhand, and in the southwest region of Tibet .
      Lake Manasarovar lies at 4,590 m (15,060 ft) above mean sea level, a
      relatively high elevation for a large fresh water lake on the mostly
      saline lake-studded Tibetan Plateau. It freezes in the winter. According
      to Brockman, it is one of the highest freshwater lakes in Asia ( highest
      being the lake tilicho in Nepal at altitude of 4919 m). Lake Manasarovar
      is relatively round in shape with the circumference of 88 km (54.7 mi).
      Its depth reaches a maximum of 90 m (300 ft) and its surface area is 320
      km2 (123.6 sq mi). It is connected to nearby Lake Rakshastal by the
      natural Ganga Chhu channel. Lake Manasarovar is near the source of the
      Sutlej, which is the easternmost large tributary of the Indus. Nearby are
      the sources of the Brahmaputra River, the Indus River, and the Karnali, an
      important tributary of the Ganges. Lake Manasarovar overflows into Lake
      Rakshastal which is a salt-water endorheic lake. When the level of Lake
      Rakshastal matched that of Lake Manasarovar, these (very narrowly)
      combined lakes overflowed into the Sutlej basin. In May 2020, India
      inaugurated a new 80 km long motorable road from Dharchula to Lipulekh
      Pass along the India-China border under the geostrategic India-China
      Border Roads project to the Kailas-Manasarovar in Tibet.
