    <h1>Etymology:</h1>
    <p>
      The Maldives has one of the most delicate environments anywhere on the
      planet. Coral reefs are the foundation of the islands. They offer
      protection to the tiny islands as its natural defense system, and the
      country’s economy depends heavily on the health of its reefs and
      ecosystems. Several conservation efforts are underway to protect the
      valuable marine environment of Maldives. While several marine species and
      birds are protected by law, protected areas have been designated to ensure
      the conservation of specific ecosystems and the rich biodiversity of the
      country. This includes designated nature reserves in islands of various
      atolls to protect wetlands and mangroves and the protection of marine
      areas and the designation of biosphere reserves that covers coral reefs,
      islands, sea grass beds and mangroves. Several resorts too conduct their
      own programs. While some programs conducted by resorts focus on the
      protection and rehabilitation of sea turtles, others are engaged in
      cutting edge research on regeneration of coral reefs. Several community
      education programs are also conducted by resorts for school children and
      the community at large. Non-governmental organizations also play an
      important role through their voluntary programs and conduct regular beach
      and reef clean up programs. Visitors to Maldives are advised to carry back
      their own non-biodegradable waste and to take care not to stand on, touch
      or remove coral structures while snorkeling or diving.
